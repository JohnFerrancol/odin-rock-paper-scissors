## Overview

This is a project from [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com): [Project: Rock Paper Scissors](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors) This project had us create the Popular Game of [Rock, Paper, Scissors](https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Rock,-Paper,-Scissors) using HTML, CSS and Javascript. This involved the implementation of basic programming concepts like Functions, Loops as well as conditional statements.

## Learning Points
- Understood basic Javascript concepts (Variables, operators, data types, conditionals, functions)
- Understood basic DOM Manipulation and Event Listeners

## Roadmap
- [x] Write the logic to get the computer choice and the player's choice through the prompt function
- [x] Applying DOM Manipulation to show the current scores
- [x] Writing functions to handle the logic on playing 1 round and playing a game (playing x number of the rounds until someone gets the score of 5)
- [x] Revisited the project to get the user to interact with the UI instead of the prompt and the console
